**DISCLAIMER:**	  
<!-- **This game does not represent any one coding bootcamp, it is just my interpretation.	
And spoiler alert, but the goal of this game is to graduate and get a job. Completing the basic obstacles in this game does not resemble how to get a job in the real world**  -->

## Description

TronClone will be a 2d arcade lightcycle style game featuring a human controlled player, a computer controlled player and various power ups to add a twist on the classic game. Developed using ruby and tested with rspec.



---



## Motivation

We are making this app to be enjoyed by whomever uses it, primarily it is a practice at good developer habits including but not limited to good use of version control, developing and executing a pre thought out development plan, using collaboration tools like Trello and doing good test driven development with rspec. Finally this app will be a nice addition to a portfolio of work.

### Current features:  
<!-- - player will face challenges involving 3 questions
- player will get different amounts of EXP depending on how they complete the challenges
- at multiple points throughout the game the player is offered opportunities to give up
- player can level up with extra activities
- once player reaches desired EXP, they graduate and look for a job (complete the game)

- add assignments as another challenge for the player
- have EXP levels for each sub class of extra activities that contribute and also have different modifiers that calculate towards total EXP
- have the ability for a player to start out at different levels (master, advanced, beginner and noob programmers), for initial release, everyone starts out at noob
- have different levels of questions i.e. they will get harder as the game progresses, and also if the player chooses to start out at a higher level they will receive harder questions form the start -->

## Copyright, ethical, social issues

<!-- Copyright wasn't thought to be of concern as the game is free, open sourced and a text-based game. The only issue that was raised before development was that it can't associate with any particular branding qualities from a learning to code course. This made the game text more generic, departing from any issues surrounding this. -->
