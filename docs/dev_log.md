### Major Milestone near Halfway
<!-- When scrolling through the 'tty-prompt' Gem, I can't remember what I was looking at, but I managed to come up with the idea of how to make the much more interactive and fun to play. Initially the challenges were going to consist of a lot of wait (sleep) methods, which would resemble people learning and stumbling. However, the idea I came up with was to incorporate real coding questions into the challenges. The MCQ Kahoot questions in the bootcamp I attend heavily inspired the style.
This would change a large chunk of my plan for Challenges, but it was worth undertaking as the game would be much more enjoyable. I still used the fundamentals of the original Challenges Flow Chart, but would alter it them, in turn making the flow more condensed as well. As can be seen in the 2 images provided. -->

### Midway Final Testing Status Update

<!-- For the most part, the design of my app didn't sway from original idea. There was the change in how Challenges worked, and how that Extra Activities just showed a countdown timer instead of giving the player an option to select what how to react to it (as I wanted to strongly suggest the time taken to do these tasks is time worth spent, rather than giving the player a cheat way to earn EXP). I mainly tested the game throughout the development to ensure the functions were working as intended. Enough time wasn't spent on developing the testing criteria initially, this was due because I felt the use of 'tty-prompt' would solve a lot of my User Input issues. It did, but a colleague raised my attention to an area where I could have tested to ensure the correct data was being sent between methods. I have taken this as a learning curve to focus more on it next time. That should reduce some debug time, however that should not detract away from the importance of testing throughout development. As the 'feel' of your app needs to be taken into account and sometimes that can only be seen when it's happening in front of us.  -->
